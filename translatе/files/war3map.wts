STRING 7
{
It has been a few months since the victory at the Black Citadel. The continuous fighting has left Outland devastated, though the hope for peace has still befallen upon this land.

However, good times do not last. Outland has been experiencing strong earthquakes recently. Warchief Thrall has been vigilant in regard to these abnormal occurrences, and is filled with worries about the Horde's and the orcs' future.
